# EOG-Based-Game
#The project is a simulation for a game with eye movements which takes the movement and 
predict its direction and move the block according to the prediction.
#For preprocessing, we applied band-pass filters and down-sampling functions.
#For feature extraction, we used DWT and morphological operations. For classification, we applied linear regression, decision tree, and SVM.
